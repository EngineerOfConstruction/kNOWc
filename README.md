# What's this for? 

Oh, hello. To put it short: This is supposed to be a Guide-/ Geo-Informational-App for Information on one's Location and Environment.

Cool, sounds pretty vague, so what is it supposed to be exactly, a GPS-Tracker, a list of Delivery-Store-Locations, a newer Google-Maps? (Pokémon© GO?) 

Well, it is meant to be an App with the help of which people can get Information about places, cities and locations, can get an overview over activities, sights and various information about 
the place they are currently at. 

So that People which are in, say, 'Berlin', will know, what there is, what they might be wanting to see, where they may want to go, what kind of activities and terrain awaits them, ect. 

This App will be envisioned to use Cartographic Material, as well as informational Mapping and Data, provided by the 'Google-Maps-API', more efficiently with added funtionality.

As for the time of writing, the project is still at its roots, at the Pre-Pro-Version (Which preceeds the Alpha- and Beta-Release), that is, therefor, 
the app is intended to yet include quite a few, perhaps even many, (Re-)Releases and thus will consequentially undergo a lot of changes, 
which will manifest and express themselfes all from the functionality and Nature of the App, to its Permissions and Policy. 

The Approach of the App will be flexible, the Intent*, will stay the same. 

Crucial and Core-Functionalities are yet to be added in later Versions. 

The Project was destined to be released as Open-source, someday (V.1?). 

As for now, the Repository will just contain the Policies (V. Pre-Pro). 

The Project will be initially restricted to Germany.

Hope it turns out to be helpful.
